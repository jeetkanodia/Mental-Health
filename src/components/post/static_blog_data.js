    content: "I’ll keep this short. I’ve got a job, a loving family, a car, friends who care deeply about me, and endless opportunity. Yet, I cannot stop thinking about how there’s no point to it all. Does anybody else around my age (18-24) have the same impending sense that no matter what you put your effort into it’s not going to matter? The world is such a volatile shitty place and society keeps changing. Am I preparing for a life I’ll never have the chance to live? I often think about how I wouldn’t have time for depression or anxiety if we were still hunter gatherers. How can I be sad when I gotta get off my ass to hunt down dinner and find water?",
